c-ini - Ini-File Handling

ABOUT:
        The c-ini project implements APIs to deal with ini-files. Different
        formats can be supported, but all share common ini-file properties,
        mainly that they are human-readable, grouped key-value pairs.

        For API documentation, see the public header files, as well as the
        docbook comments for each function.
